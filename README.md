I've gather informations and created this article for sysadmin who're using CentOS or Enterprise Linux.
Because most of these linux branches have a long term support, f_cking stable and secured (SELinux). 
However, most libraries and applications that preinstalled are obsolete. 
So this article will guide you to build a perfect web server with modern applications (HTTP/2 support).

Please read: This article **compatible with RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.x**, except some repository links need to change upon vendors and processor architecture of your hardware.

## Introduction

The new CentOS 7 server has to be customized before it can be put into use as a production system. In this article, will help you to increase the security and usability of your server with the lastest stable packages and will give you a solid foundation for subsequent actions.

## Prerequisites

A newly activated CentOS 7 server, preferably setup with SSH keys. Log into the server as root with your server-ip-address.

```
ssh -l root xx.xx.xxx.xxx
```
or
```
ssh root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```

To view current ip of server in CentOS
```
# For minimal install
ip addr
```
or
```
ifconfig
```

Complete the login process by accepting the warning about host authenticity, if it appears, then providing your root authentication (password or private key). If it is your first time logging into the server, with a password, you will also be prompted to change the root password.

The root user is the administrative user in a Linux environment that has very broad privileges. Because of the heightened privileges of the root account, you are actually discouraged from using it on a regular basis. This is because part of the power inherent with the root account is the ability to make very destructive changes, even by accident.

The next step is to set up an alternative user account with a reduced scope of influence for day-to-day work. We'll teach you how to gain increased privileges during the times when you need them.


## Setup and Initial

### Step 1 — Create a New User

For security reasons, it is not advisable to be performing daily computing tasks using the root account. Instead, it is recommended to create a standard user account that will be using sudo to gain administrative privileges. For this tutorial, assume that we're creating a user named joe. To create the user account, type:

```
adduser example
```
Set a password for the new user. You'll be prompted to input and confirm a password.

```
passwd example
```
Add the new user to the wheel group so that it can assume root privileges using sudo.

```
gpasswd -a example wheel
```

Finally, open another terminal on your local machine and use the following command to add your SSH key to the new user's home directory on the remote server. You will be prompted to authenticate before the SSH key is installed.

```
ssh-copy-id example@server-ip-address
```
After the key has been installed, log into the server using the new user account.

```
ssh -l example server-ip-address
```

If the login is successful, you may close the other terminal. From now on, all commands will be preceded with sudo.


### Step 2 — Disallow Root Login and Password Authentication

Since you can now log in as a standard user using SSH keys, a good security practice is to configure SSH so that the root login and password authentication are both disallowed. Both settings have to be configured in the SSH daemon's configuration file. So, open it using nano.

```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Look for the PermitRootLogin line, uncomment it and set the value to no.
```
PermitRootLogin     no
```
Do the same for the PasswordAuthentication line, which should be uncommented already:
```
PasswordAuthentication      no
```
Save and close the file. To apply the new settings, reload SSH.
```
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

### Step 3 — Configure the Timezones and Network Time Protocol Synchronization

The next step is to adjust the localization settings for your server and configure the Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization.

The first step will ensure that your server is operating under the correct time zone. The second step will configure your system to synchronize its system clock to the standard time maintained by a global network of NTP servers. This will help prevent some inconsistent behavior that can arise from out-of-sync clocks.

#### Configure Timezones

Our first step is to set our server's timezone. This is a very simple procedure that can be accomplished using the timedatectl command:

First, take a look at the available timezones by typing:

```
sudo timedatectl list-timezones
```
Grep possible Asian timezones 
```
sudo timedatectl list-timezones | grep Asia
```

This will give you a list of the timezones available for your server. When you find the region/timezone setting that is correct for your server, set it by typing:
```
sudo timedatectl set-timezone region/timezone
```

For instance, to set it to United States eastern time, you can type:
```
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York
```
Your system will be updated to use the selected timezone. You can confirm this by typing:
```
sudo timedatectl
```

#### Configure NTP Synchronization

Now that you have your timezone set, we should configure NTP. This will allow your computer to stay in sync with other servers, leading to more predictability in operations that rely on having the correct time.

For NTP synchronization, we will use a service called ntp, which we can install from CentOS's default repositories:
```
sudo yum install ntp
```
Next, you need to start the service for this session. We will also enable the service so that it is automatically started each time the server boots:
```
sudo systemctl start ntpd
sudo systemctl enable ntpd
```
Your server will now automatically correct its system clock to align with the global servers.

#### How do I see the current time zone?

Type the date command or the ls command:
```
date
ls -l /etc/localtime
```

### Step 4 - Enable the IPTables Firewall (Recommended)

By default, the active firewall application on a newly activated CentOS 7 server is FirewallD. Though it is a good replacement for IPTables, many security applications still do not have support for it. So if you'll be using any of those applications, like OSSEC HIDS, it's best to disable/uninstall FirewallD.

Let's start by disabling/uninstalling FirewallD:
```
sudo yum remove -y firewalld
```
Now, let's install/activate IPTables.

```
sudo yum install -y iptables-services
sudo systemctl start iptables
```

Configure IPTables to start automatically at boot time.
```
sudo systemctl enable iptables
```
IPTables on CentOS 7 comes with a default set of rules, which you can view with the following command.
```
sudo iptables -L -n
```
The output will resemble:

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
ACCEPT     icmp --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           
ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           
ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state NEW tcp dpt:22
REJECT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
REJECT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

You can see that one of those rules allows SSH traffic, so your SSH session is safe.
Because those rules are runtime rules and will be lost on reboot, it's best to save them to a file using:
```
sudo /usr/libexec/iptables/iptables.init save
```
That command will save the rules to the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file. You can edit the rules anytime by changing this file with your favorite text editor.

### Step 5 - Allow Additional Traffic Through the Firewall

Since you'll most likely be going to use your new server to host some websites at some point, you'll have to add new rules to the firewall to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic. To accomplish that, open the IPTables file:

```
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/iptables
```

Just after or before the SSH rule, add the rules for HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic, so that that portion of the file appears as shown in the code block below.
```
-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
```
Save and close the file, then reload IPTables.
```
sudo systemctl reload iptables
```
With the above step completed, your CentOS 7 server should now be reasonably secure and be ready for use in production.


### Step 6 - Optimized system configuration for maximum concurrancy.

In default centos server is not fully optimized to make full use of available hardware. 
This means it might fail under high load. So we need to config the sysctl.conf file for optimization.

1. Open sysctl.conf file
```
sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf
```

2. Edit file as following configuration
```
# Increase number of incoming connections
net.core.somaxconn = 16384

# Increase the maximum amount of option memory buffers
net.core.optmem_max = 25165824

# Increase Linux auto tuning TCP buffer limits
# min, default, and max number of bytes to use
# set max to at least 4MB, or higher if you use very high BDP paths
net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 65536

# Decrease the time default value for tcp_fin_timeout connection
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 15

# Number of times SYNACKs for passive TCP connection.
net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 2

# Decrease the time default value for connections to keep alive
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 300
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes = 5
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl = 15

# Enable timestamps as defined in RFC1323:
net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 1

# Allowed local port range
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 2000 65535

# Turn on window scaling which can enlarge the transfer window:
net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1

# Limit syn backlog to prevent overflow
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 30000

# Avoid a smurf attack
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

# Turn on protection for bad icmp error messages
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1

# Turn on syncookies for SYN flood attack protection
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

# Protect Against TCP Time-Wait
net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337 = 1

# Turn on and log spoofed, source routed, and redirect packets
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians = 1

# No source routed packets here
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

# Turn on reverse path filtering
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

# Make sure no one can alter the routing tables
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects = 0

# Don't act as a router
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0

# Turn on execshild protection
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2

# Optimization for port usefor LBs Increase system file descriptor limit
fs.file-max = 65535

# Allow for more PIDs (to reduce rollover problems); may break some programs 32768
kernel.pid_max = 65536

# Increase TCP max buffer size setable using setsockopt()
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 87380 16777216

# Increase the tcp-time-wait buckets pool size to prevent simple DOS attacks
net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 1440000
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1

# Disable ipv6 for security (!! Optional if you're using ipv6 !!)
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6= 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6= 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6= 1
```

3. Reload the systemctl file
```
sysctl -p
```

## Update and Upgrade

To update installed packages
```
sudo yum -y update 
```
To upgrade installed packages
```
sudo yum -y upgrade
```

## Install Common Packages

### Yum Utils 

**Yum-utils** is a collection of utilities and plugins extending and supplementing yum in different ways. It included in the base repo (which is enabled by default). However if you install as minimal you have to install it manually by typing. 

```
sudo yum -y install yum-utils
```

### Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)

How do I install the extra repositories such as Fedora EPEL repo on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server version 7.x or CentOS Linux server version 7.x?

You can easily install various packages by configuring a CentOS 7.x or RHEL 7.x system to use Fedora EPEL repos and third party packages. Please note that these packages are not officially supported by either CentOS or Red Hat, but provides many popular packages and apps.

#### How to install RHEL EPEL repository on Centos 7.x or RHEL 7.x

The following instructions assumes that you are running command as root user on a CentOS/RHEL 7.x system and want to use use Fedora Epel repos.

#### Method 1: Install EPEL repositories from Base Linux repository (recommended)

Install Epel repo using the following command:
```
sudo yum -y install epel-release
```
Refresh repo by typing the following commad: 
```
yum repolist
```

#### Method 2: Install EPEL repositories from dl.fedoraproject.org 

The command is as follows to download epel release for CentOS and RHEL 7.x using wget command:
```
cd /tmp
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh epel-release-latest-7*.rpm
```
Refresh repo by typing the following commad: 
```
yum repolist
```

#### Search and install package

To list all available packages under a repo called epel
```
sudo yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="epel" list available
```

Example: Search and install htop package from epel repo on a CentOS/RHEL 7.x

### Search it 
```
sudo yum search htop
sudo yum info htop
sudo yum install htop
```

And, there you have it, a larger number of packages to install from EPEL repo on a CentOS and 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 7.x.


### OpenSSL(with ALPN support)

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jukbot/secure-centos/master/OpenSSL-Logo.png" alt="OPENSSL"/>
</p>

**OpenSSL** is a software library to be used in applications that need to secure communications against eavesdropping or need to ascertain the identity of the party at the other end. It has found wide use in internet web servers, serving a majority of all web sites.


**Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)** is a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension for application layer protocol negotiation. ALPN allows the application layer to negotiate which protocol should be performed over a secure connection in a manner which avoids additional round trips and which is independent of the application layer protocols. It is used by HTTP/2.

***Due to TLS False Start was disabled in Google Chrome from version 20 (2012) onward except for websites with the earlier Next Protocol Negotiation (NPN) extension. NPN was replaced with a reworked version, ALPN. On July 11, 2014, ALPN was published as RFC 7301.***

#### Why Has HTTP/2 Stopped Working for Users of the New Version of Google Chrome?

As of May 2016, approximately 8% of the world’s websites are accessible over HTTP/2. These websites all use SSL/TLS, because browsers that support HTTP/2 only upgrade the connection to the new standard if SSL/TLS is also in use. The vast majority of sites – those running NGINX and LiteSpeed – depend on OpenSSL’s implementation of NPN or ALPN to upgrade to HTTP/2.

**OpenSSL added ALPN support on January 2015, in version 1.0.2. Versions 1.0.1 and earlier do not support ALPN.**

Unlike a standalone web server like NGINX, OpenSSL is a core operating system library that is used by many of the packages shipped as part of a modern Linux operating system. To ensure the operating system is stable and reliable, OS distributors do not make major updates to packages such as OpenSSL during the lifetime of each release. They do backport critical OpenSSL patches to their supported versions of OpenSSL to protect their users against OpenSSL vulnerabilities. They do not backport new features, particularly those which change the ABI of essential shared libraries.

<p align="center">
The table summarizes operating system support for ALPN and NPN.
  <a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/supporting-http2-google-chrome-users/" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jukbot/secure-centos/master/alpn_os_support.PNG" alt="OS that support ALPN"/>
  </a>
</p>

As you can see, only Ubuntu 16.04 LTS supports ALPN. This means that if you’re running your website on any other major operating system, the OpenSSL version shipped with the operating system does not support ALPN and Chrome users will be downgraded to HTTP/1.1

So to enable HTTP/2 on ALPN in chrome browser you need to be sure that you have already installed ***OpenSSL that supported ALPN** which is version >= 1.0.2.

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL#Major_version_releases


### The following steps describe how to upgrade OpenSSL 

To compile openssl from source you need to install compiler and required libraries to build nginx.
```
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
sudo yum -y install gcc gcc-c++ make unzip autoconf automake zlib-devel pcre-devel openssl-devel zlib-devel pam-devel
```

1). Verify the current openssl version by command
```
openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013
```

2). To view the lastest openssl package from base repository
```
yum info openssl
```

3). Download the latest version of OpenSSL, do as follows:
```
cd /usr/local/src/
wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.0-latest.tar.gz
tar -zxf openssl-1.1.0-latest.tar.gz
```

Note: 
- If you want to install other version you can download it from https://www.openssl.org/source/
- We will use latest openssl version 1.1.x from official website.


4). Go to the source directory, then generate a config file with the following commands

```
cd openssl-1.1.0f
./config
```

Alphabet suffix 'l' of openssl version number depends on release of openssl.

5). Compile the source, test and then install the package (need root permission)

```
make
make test
make install
```

Note: This will take a while depending on CPU capacity. If your CPU has more than 1 core you can added suffix -j4 for using 4 cores to compile the source code.

For example: make -j4 to use all 4 cores to compile the source code.

6). Move old openssl installed version to the root folder for backup or you can delete it
```
mv /usr/bin/openssl /root/
```

7). Create a symbolic link
```
ln -s /usr/local/bin/openssl /usr/bin/openssl
```

8). Verify the OpenSSL version 
```
openssl version
OpenSSL 1.1.0f  25 May 2017
```

!! Done. Easy right let continue the next package ? !!


### Nginx from source (with ALPN support + HTTP2)

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jukbot/secure-centos/master/NGINX_logo.png" alt="NGINX"/>
</p>

Compiling NGINX from the sources provides you with more flexibility: you can add particular NGINX modules or 3rd party modules and apply latest security patches.

### Choosing Between a Stable or a Mainline Version

NGINX Open Source is available in 2 versions:

**The mainline version** This version includes the latest features and bugfixes and is always up-to-date. It is reliable, but it may include some experimental modules, and it may also have some number of new bugs.

**The stable version** This version doesn’t have new features, but includes critical bug fixes that are always backported to the mainline version. The stable version is recommended for production servers.


### Prerequisites

**!! Before we getting start you need to verify that you have already installed openssl with ALPN support**
```
openssl version
```
The openssl version must be 1.0.2 or higher.


### Step 1 Install compiler and libraries (If you already installed skip this step)

To compile nginx from source you need to install compiler and required libraries to build nginx.

1.1 Need to install epel repo for additional libraries, if not install by typing
```
sudo yum install -y epel-release
```
1.2 Then update the os environment
```
sudo yum update 
```
1.3 Install the compiler 
```
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
sudo yum -y install autoconf automake bind-utils wget curl unzip gcc-c++ pcre-devel zlib-devel libtool make nmap-netcat ntp pam-devel
```

### Step 2 Installing NGINX Dependencies

Prior to compiling NGINX from the sources, it is necessary to install its dependencies:

2.1 Install PCRE library (January 11, 2017)
The PCRE library required by NGINX Core and Rewrite modules and provides support for regular expressions:
```
cd /usr/local/src
wget ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-8.41.tar.gz
tar -zxf pcre-8.41.tar.gz
cd pcre-8.41
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

2.2 Install ZLIB library (January 15, 2017)
The zlib library required by NGINX Gzip module for headers compression:
```
cd /usr/local/src
wget http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz
tar -zxf zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz
cd zlib-1.2.11
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

2.3 Install OpenSSL library (lastest or >= 1.0.2)
The OpenSSL library required by NGINX SSL modules to support the HTTPS protocol:

Please see the OpenSSL (with ALPN support) section


### Step 3 Download NGINX source code

```
cd /usr/local/src
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.12.1.tar.gz
tar zxf nginx-1.12.1.tar.gz
cd nginx-1.12.1
```

Other version please see https://nginx.org/en/download.html

3.1 Config the nginx for built

```
NOTE!! Please change the library version to your current library path version. For example

--with-pcre=/usr/local/src/pcre-8.41 \
--with-zlib=/usr/local/src/zlib-1.2.11 \
--with-openssl=/usr/local/src/openssl-1.1.0f \
```

#### NGINX Compile configure detail (TL;DR)

First, we'll set prefix to /etc/nginx for our nginx installation path. 

Next, set sbin path to /usr/sbin/nginx for storing our nginx process.

Next, set modules path to /usr/lib64/nginx/modules for storing our ngnx modules.

Next, set conf path to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf for storing our default global nginx config file.

Next, set error log path to /var/log/nginx/error.log for storing our error log file location.

Next, set http log path to /var/log/nginx/access.log for storing our http log file location.

Next, set pid path to /var/run/nginx.pid to set the name for main process ID file.

Next, set lock path to /var/run/nginx.lock to set the name for Nginx lock file.

Next, set http-client-body-temp path to /var/cache/nginx/client_temp for storing client temporary cache.

Next, set http-proxy-temp path to /var/cache/nginx/proxy_temp for storing temporary proxy.

Next, set http-fastcgi-temp path to /var/cache/nginx/fastcgi_temp for storing fastcgi cache. (commonly used in PHP)

Next, set http-uwsgi-temp path to /var/cache/nginx/uwsgi_temp for storing uwsgi cache.

Next, set http-scgi-temp path to /var/cache/nginx/scgi_temp for storing scgi cache.

Next, set user as nginx.

Next, set group as nginx.

Next, set pcre (required library) path to /usr/local/src/pcre-8.41 that where you downloaded source to.

Next, set zlib (required library) path to /usr/local/src/zlib-1.2.11 that where you downloaded source to.

Next, set openssl (required library) path to /usr/local/src/openssl-1.1.0f that where you downloaded source to.

Next, add ssl http module for enables used SSL/TLS (https) in nginx. (VERY recommeded I love HTTPS !!)

Next, add http_v2 module for enables used http2 in nginx. (Required http_ssl_module !!!)

Next, add http_realip_module to change the client address to the one sent in the specified header field.
Next, add threads, file-aio for enables NGINX to use thread pools, asynchronous I/O.

Next, add addition_module for adds text before and after a response.

Next, add sub_module to modifies a response by replacing one specified string by another.

Next, add dav_module to intend for file management automation via the WebDAV protocol.

Next, add flv_module to provide pseudo-streaming server-side support for Flash Video (FLV) files.

Next, add mp4_module to provide pseudo-streaming server-side support for MP4 files.

Next, add gunzip_module for decompresses responses with Content-Encoding: gzip for clients that do not support zip encoding 
method.

Next, add gzip_static_module for allows sending precompressed files with the *.gz filename extension instead of regular 
files.

Next, add auth_request_module to implement client authorization based on the result of a subrequest.

Next, add random_index_module for processes requests ending with the slash character (‘/’) and picks a random file in a 
directory to serve as an index file.

Next, add secure_link_module for used to check authenticity of requested links, protect resources from unauthorized access, 
and limit link lifetime.

Next, add slice_module for allows splitting a request into subrequests, each subrequest returns a certain range of 
response. Provides more effective caching of large files.

Next, add degradation_module for allows returning an error when a memory size exceeds the defined value.

Next, add stub_status_module to provides access to basic status information.

Next, add mail module to enable mail proxy functionality. (OPTIONAL)

Next, add mail_ssl_module to provide support for a mail proxy server to work with the SSL/TLS protocol. (OPTIONAL) 
(Requires an SSL library such as OpenSSL.)

Next, add stream module to enable the TCP proxy functionality. (OPTIONAL)

Next, add stream_ssl_module to provide support for a stream proxy server to work with the SSL/TLS protocol. (OPTIONAL)
(Requires an SSL library such as OpenSSL.)

NOTE: Someone ask WHERE IS FU_KING ipv6 module? according to the changes with nginx 1.11.5 (11 Oct 2016) now this configure option was removed and IPv6 support is configured by default automatically.

```

3.2 Compile and install the build:
```
make
sudo make install
```

3.3 After the installation process has finished with success add nginx system user (with /etc/nginx/ as his home directory and with no valid shell), the user that Nginx will run as by issuing the following command.

```
useradd -d /etc/nginx/ -s /sbin/nologin nginx
```

3.4 Change user in nginx configure file
```
vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
# Then change the user from nobody to nginx, then save and exit.

user nginx;
```

3.5 Config the firewall
```
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=https
systemctl restart firewalld.service
```

3.5 start nginx service by using below command
```
/usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

3.6 check nginx process 
```
ps -ef|grep nginx
```

3.7 to stop nginx service using below command
```
kill -9 PID-Of-Nginx
```

3.8 add nginx as systemd service by create a file "nginx.service" in /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service
 then copy below into the file
 
```

3.11 set permission to make this script be executable 
```
chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx

3.12 To make sure that Nginx starts and stops every time with the Droplet, add it to the default runlevels with the command:
```
sudo chkconfig nginx on
sudo service nginx restart
```

3.13 Finally, to verify nginx version and opensssl that built by type**
```
nginx -V
```
and it will show
```
nginx version: nginx/1.12.1

```

3.14 Start nginx 
```
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

If you see this error
```
nginx: [emerg] mkdir() "/var/cache/nginx/client_temp" failed (2: No such file or directory)
```

Then manually create the file /var/cache/nginx/client_temp.
```
sudo mkdir /var/cache/nginx
sudo touch /var/cache/nginx/client_temp

### Step 4 Setup Nginx web server (SSL + HTTP2)

For using http2 you need to have certificate (SSL) installed

#1. Go to nginx global file directory

```
sudo su
cd /etc/nginx/
vi nginx.conf
```

#2. Config the file as below 

```
user  nginx;
worker_processes auto;
pid   /var/run/nginx.pid;

## Set Up FirewallD

### Introduction

After setting up the bare minimum configuration for a new server, there are some additional steps that are highly recommended in most cases.

### Prerequisites

In this guide, we will be focusing on configuring some optional but recommended components. This will involve setting our system up with a firewall and a swap file.

### Configuring a Basic Firewall

Firewalls provide a basic level of security for your server. These applications are responsible for denying traffic to every port on your server with exceptions for ports/services you have approved. CentOS ships with a firewall called firewalld. A tool called firewall-cmd can be used to configure your firewall policies. Our basic strategy will be to lock down everything that we do not have a good reason to keep open.

The firewalld service has the ability to make modifications without dropping current connections, so we can turn it on before creating our exceptions:
```
sudo systemctl start firewalld
```
Now that the service is up and running, we can use the firewall-cmd utility to get and set policy information for the firewall. The firewalld application uses the concept of "zones" to label the trustworthiness of the other hosts on a network. This labelling gives us the ability to assign different rules depending on how much we trust a network.

In this guide, we will only be adjusting the policies for the default zone. When we reload our firewall, this will be the zone applied to our interfaces. We should start by adding exceptions to our firewall for approved services. The most essential of these is SSH, since we need to retain remote administrative access to the server.

You can enable the service by name (eg ssh-daemon) by typing:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
```
or disable it by typing:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=ssh
```
or enable custom port by typing:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=4200/tcp
```
This is the bare minimum needed to retain administrative access to the server. If you plan on running additional services, you need to open the firewall for those as well.

If you plan on running a conventional HTTP web server, you will need to enable the http service:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
```
If you plan to run a web server with SSL/TLS enabled, you should allow traffic for https as well:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
```
If you need SMTP email enabled, you can type:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=smtp
```
To see any additional services that you can enable by name, type:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --get-services
```
When you are finished, you can see the list of the exceptions that will be implemented by typing:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --list-all
```
When you are ready to implement the changes, reload the firewall:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
If, after testing, everything works as expected, you should make sure the firewall will be started at boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable firewalld
```
Remember that you will have to explicitly open the firewall (with services or ports) for any additional services that you may configure later.
